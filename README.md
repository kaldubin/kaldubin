- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @kaldubin
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in software development, robotics, AI, space and physic science (like particule's physics etc.)
Mostly works on small project here like AI for creating custom Beat Saber Map, little softwares to try new things.

Most of the projects repositories I have worked on with this account were created by friends and put on private so...
But you can check the TRAS repo which is about a software for transiting exoplanets (I feel lucky and proud to have worked on this project with friends).
